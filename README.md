# SVBHACK

This is a fork of [pelican-svbhack](https://github.com/gfidente/pelican-svbhack)
most of my changes here will just be small tweaks that I want to use for 
[my site](https://xo.tc). You are probably better off using the original but
you're welcome to use this version, or cherry pick just the commits you like.

If I make any changes that I think are truly useful or worth sharing I'll make a
pull request.
